# C Practice Repository: Based on *The C Beginner's Handbook* by Flavio Copes

Welcome! This repository is designed to help me practice and reinforce my understanding of the **C programming language** by working through the core topics covered in [*The C Beginner's Handbook*](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-c-beginners-handbook/#heading-constants), written by **Flavio Copes**.

The book follows the 80/20 rule: learn 80% of the language in 20% of the time. It focuses on practical, essential concepts without overwhelming with edge cases or overly advanced topics.

## ðŸ§ª Purpose

- Practice and solidify C programming concepts by writing small, focused programs.
- Organize code examples into logically separated folders.
- Prepare for interviews, technical assessments, or just deepen understanding of C.

---

## ðŸ”§ How to Use

Each folder:
- Contains a focused `.c` file (or multiple) practicing the topic.
- Is self-contained and can be compiled with `gcc` or any standard C compiler.

Example:
```bash
cd 05-loops
gcc loops.c -o loops
./loops
